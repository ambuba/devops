*** Need For Docker ***

- Compatibility/Depnendency Management
- Long Setup Times
- Different Dev/Test/Prod Environments

*** What Docker Does ***

- Package & Containerize Apps (Containers - Completely isolated environments)
- Containers are lightweight
- Run each service with its own dependencies in separate containers
- Image - Package / Template used to create a container
- Container - an instance of running and isolated image with its own dependencies
- A container only lives as long as the process within it is running. Once finished, the container exits

*** Docker Commands

> docker run                    #Start a container 
> docker ps  {-a}               #List all running containers  
> docker stop silly_samet       #Stop a container
> docker rm silly_samet         #Permanently remove a container
> docker images                 #List available or downloaded images on the host
> docker rmi nginx              #Remove the NGINX image. Ensure all dependent containers are deleted first
> docker pull redis             #Only pull/download the image from registry but don't run it
> docker run -it centos bash    #Execute a command on a running docker container
> docker run ubuntu sleep 5     #Execute a command when running a container
> docker run webapp             #Running command t\like this runs it in attached mode (Foreground)
> docker run -d webapp          #Runs in detached mode (Background) - Note the ID assigned "a043d40..."
> docker attach a043d           #ARe-attach to a detached container running in the background
> docker exec a043d cat /etc/   #Execute a command on a running container
